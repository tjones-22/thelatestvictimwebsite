Welcome to the Latest Victims offical webpage.

This is my first time using both Next.js and some tailwind css

I hope for longevity and to be able to add the rest of the features I wanted to.

Things left still to do:
- Create database
- store images and potential users in db
- make api requests for photos, song, and member data
- ad an admin part of the app where admin can add photos, set songs, and ad show/tour dates.
